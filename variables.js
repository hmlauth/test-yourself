// VARIABLE DECLARATIONS
// a. How does one declare a variable? 
// - Declare a variable called "name" and assign a string to it.
// - Declare a variable called "isStudying" and assign a boolean value to it.
// - Declare a variable called "age" and assign a number to it.
// - Create a reference called "school" and assign a string to it
// - Create a reference called "isLiving" and assign a boolean value to it.
// - Create a reference called "hours" and assigne a number to it.
// - Reflect: Why can one call a "variable" a "reference"? 
// - Reflect: What is happening in the computer with variable declarations?
// c. What is the best practice naming convention for variable names?
// d. After a variable is declared/initialized, how do we use, or "reference", that variable throughout our code?
// e. What is the difference between var, let and const?
// - How does the keyword used in a variable declaration affect what we can do with that variable?
// For example, run this code:
    const age = 10;
    age = 12;
// What error do you get and why? How does this differ if your variable declaration is used with "let" or "var"?
