## Who is this repo for? 
**Educator**: As an instructor or TA, or to screen a job candidate, test if the person at hand knows some basics! Can they explain it? Can they pick it apart? Can they apply what they know to a more challenging question? I give this assessment to any new student I work with no matter their current level. From here you can build with them.  

**Student**:  A great self-assessment to anyone wondering, _what do I know and what do I need to study_? I love tests for that very reason! Tests are a great opportunity to gauge your current level of retention, comprehension and associations. See where you're at and where to focus your studies.

*Please note that the assessment assumes you've learned the basics of variables, functions, for loops, and are at least aware of array methods.
