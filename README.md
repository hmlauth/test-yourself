## Who is this repo for? 
**Educator**: As an instructor or TA, or for an interview, test if the person at hand knows some basics! Can they explain it? Can they pick it apart? Can they apply what they know to a more challenging question? For any new student I work with I give them this because it helps me expose where support is needed. 

**Student**:  A great self-assessment to any wondering, _what do I know and what do I need to study_? I love tests for that very reason! Tests are a great opportunity to gauge your current level of retention, comprehension and associations. Please note that the assessment assumes you've learned the basics of variables, functions, for loops, and are at least aware of array methods.

## How to Use

2. Take assessment of choice.
