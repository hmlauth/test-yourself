// ARRAYS
// What is the notation for an array? 
// How are arrays organized? What is each position in an array called?
// How can you access the length of an array? 
// - What does the "length" of an array refer too?
// - How does the "length" differ from the last index?
// Create an array called "numbers" that contains numbers 1 - 10.
// Create an array called "persons" that contain 10 names.
// How do I access the first element in each of these arrays (numbers & persons)? Print the result to the console using console.log();
// What is the "tool" called that is the most basic to "loop" or "iterate" over an array? 
// Write the syntax for this "tool" (use "var" for any variable declarations)
// Loop over your numbers array and print each value to the console. 
// - Add comments to each line describing what is happening and why.
// - What are the conditions of our loop and how do they control our loop?
// Outside of your loop, console.log(i). What is printed to the console? 
// Now change the declaration of i from "var i = 0" to "let i = 0". Console.log(i) outside of your loop. What is printed to the console now, and why?
