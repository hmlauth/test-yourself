// FUNCTIONS
// What is a function?
// What is the difference between a function definition and a function call?
// What is the different between parameters and arguments? 
// What does the key word "return" do and when would you use it?
// What is the basic structure/syntax of a function definition? Write it in two ways.
// Write a function called sumNumbers that returns the sum of it's two inputs. The function definition must have 2 parameters defined.
// Call your function and provide it with 2 real values. Describe what happened, how and why.
// Declare two variables, x and y, and set them equal to 2 and 3, respectively.
    /*
        const x = 2;
        const y = 3;
        let result;
    */

// Write a function called multiplyNumbers that returns the product of x and y. Do not define any parameters. 

// Run the code below. What happens? Expected output: 6
    /*
        result = multiplyNumbers();
        console.log(result);
    */

// Now run the code below. What happens? Was the output what you expected? If not, why? 
    /*
        result = multiplyNumbers(5,5);
        console.log(result);
    */

// Now add x and y as parameters in your function definition the rerun the code. What happens? How did this change the final result? 

// What is it called when variables are only accessible within certain code blocks? What is the general rule of thumb when it comes to ___________ ? (HINT: "You can see _____, but you can't see ____.")
