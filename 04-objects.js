// OBJECTS
// What is the notation for an object?
// What do objects contain/how do they differ from arrays? 
// What are each of the "pairs" in an object called? Why?
// How does a property differ from a method?
// Create an object called "persons" with the following properties: name, age, profession. Set the values to "Jane", 20, and "Engineer".
// - Access the name, age and profession properties using dot notation.
// - Access the name, age and profession properties using bracket notation.
// - Access the name, age and profession properties using object destructuring.
// - Add a method called "walking" to your person object.
// - Call the method "walking".
// - Add a new property called "isWalking" to your person object using dot notation. Set the value of this pproperty to false.
// - Add a new property called "isWalking" to your person object using bracket notation. Set the value of this pproperty to false.
// How does one loop over an object? What are the basic conditions/components of this loop and why?
// Loop over your person object and print the property names to the console.
// Output will looks like:
    /*
        name
        age
        profession
    */
// Create a new loop and print the value of each property to the console.
// Output will looks like:
    /*
        Jane
        20
        Engineer
    */
// Create a new loop and print both the property name and value to the console. 
// Output will looks like:
    /*
        name: Jane
        age: 20
        profession: Engineer
    */
